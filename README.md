# SpawnPointMod

This is a mod for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, built on top of Minecraft's scripting API.
Some of the infrastructure comes from Microsoft's starter/example mods, but everything
outside of the build process is my own work. This mod adds a number of custom commands for 
players to use, most notably the "!setspawn" command, which allows you to set a secondary 
spawn point and then select between the secondary spawn and the original spawn after dying in-game.
There are some other for-fun commands in progress, and also some secret things that I built in 
to mess with some of my friends on our Minecraft realm.
